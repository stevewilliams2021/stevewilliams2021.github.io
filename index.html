  <p>This site was started in 2021, but was quickly abandoned for a year. The real work on it started in June of 2022. I'm ready to study programming and create things once again, which I haven't done much over the last decade. I've got several newer technologies that I will study and demostrate throughout this site as I learn them. First, though, a little background on my experience with computers to date.</p>

  <p>I got my first computer in the late 1980s, and through my dream as a child was to program video games, the reality was that I just played video games. I did, however, get some fairly decent command line skills very early on, as Windows did not even exist yet and you had to use DOS - A LOT.</p>
  
  <p>and started teaching myself "programming" around 1999. I use quotes here as my first real experience with it was just Excel formulas. </p>
