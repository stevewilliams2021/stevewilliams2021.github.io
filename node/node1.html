  <h1>Node - First Steps</h1>

  <p>The only tools that you need to work with node are a recent version of node.js and a text editor. Once you have
    those, you are ready to begin. To start a new node project, you will need to go to your command prompt. Navigate to
    or create a folder for your node project. Once inside the directory where you want your code to reside, type:</p>

  <div class="code">npm init</div>

  <p>You will be asked a series of questions about properties of your project (hit Enter to accept defaults), and your
    selections will be written to a file named <code>package.json</code> (in the main project directory). Next, create a
    <code>bin</code> folder, and add a file called <code>index.js</code> to this folder. Add the following lines of code
    to this file:
  </p>

  <div class="code">#!/usr/bin/env node<br>
    <br>
    console.log('Hello world!');
  </div>

  <p>The first line that begins with <code>#!</code> is usually called a <em>shebang</em> This is normally only used on
    Linux or UNIX operating systems to inform the system what type of script is included in the rest of the text file.
    However, this first line is also required for node.js scripts to be installed and run properly on macOS and Windows.
  </p>

  <p>Since Javascript is interpreted, it needs an interpreter. You can run our Javascript file with node.js from the
    command line with:</p>

  <div class="code">node bin/index.js</div>

  <p>Or alternatively (since index.js is default):</p>

  <div class="code">node bin</div>

  <p>By typing node, we are telling the shell how to run the script, but when you use a shebang this is included in the
    script itself. When it has this, it can be run directly as if it was a binary:</p>

  <div class="code">bin/index.js</div>

  <p>It can also be executed from a bash script (.sh), such as (note the shebang specifying what to run this with):</p>

  <div class="code">#!/bin/sh<br>
    <br>
    bin/index.js
  </div>

  <p>This could be in our root folder, and if we name it <code>run.sh</code> then we can call it like so (assuming bash
    is set in your PATH):</p>

  <div class="code">bash run.sh</div>

  <p>Node (and browsers) will ignore the shebang as a comment if it is the first line of the file. By using
    <code>#!/usr/bin/env node</code>, we're telling the OS to run <code>env</code>, and env will run node, and node will
    in turn execute the script. The main use of env is to run a command in a modified environment. The emphasis here
    being "a command" because env is almost always at /usr/bin/env while "a command" can be anything that's on the PATH
    (in this case node - also putting bash and related utilities is useful too, if not necessary).
  </p>

  <p>Passing the <code>-S</code> option to env causes it to parse whatever comes after, which can be used to pass
    parameters to the command (node for this discussion). While an in-depth discussion of that is beyond the scope of an
    intro document, we will look at one example. In the bin folder, make a 2nd Javascript file called
    <code>first.js</code>. It can have just a single line of code, <code>console.log('I got called first!');</code>.
    Then, modify the shebang in index.js to read <code>#!/usr/bin/env -S node -r ./bin/first.js</code>. Using the
    <code>-r</code> option of the node command causes another script to run before the current script. Now call index.js
    by running <code>bash run.sh</code> from the project directory. Two observations after having done this (and being
    frustrated a while). First, after the -r in this example, you must have ./ before bin/first.js. Don't ask me why,
    but if you don't put it there it calls the 2nd script only and never comes back to the first (prints only "I got
    called first"). Second, if you try to run index.js directly from node (as opposed to bash with a script), it will
    ignore the shebang and just run the script (only "Hello World!").
  </p>

  <p>Again, note that if you run the script like <code>node bin/index.js</code>, node.js will not try to parse arguments
    from the shebang. It'll just ignore it. It is the kernel which uses the shebang prior to running the file in order
    to figure out how to run it. I tried to modify the .sh shebang to make these files executable without the bash
    keyword (like above with node) but was unsuccessful. Another shebang that works fine and specifes bash (rather than
    sh, but still have to call with bash...) is <code>#!/bin/bash</code>.</p>

  <p>There are many more things you can do with env and node, such as setting environment variables, force-disabling
    debugging for users, etc. As I said, this is an intro, but here is the <a
      href="https://alexewerlof.medium.com/node-shebang-e1d4b02f731d">page</a> where I got a lot of this information
    from, and that contains more.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>Let's go back to the start, and edit the package.json file that was generated when we ran npm init. Change the
    <code>main</code> value to <code>bin/index.js</code>. Add a new keyword for <code>bin</code> with the text
    <code>"hello": "./bin/index.js"</code>. The package.json file should now look like similar to the following:
  </p>

  <div class="code">
    {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "first-steps",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"version": "1.0.0",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"description": "Program from first steps tutorial",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"main": "bin/index.js",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"scripts": {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;},<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"author": "Steve Williams",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"license": "ISC",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"bin": {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"hello": "./bin/index.js"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
    }
  </div>

  <p>Due to the change we made to <code>main</code>, we can now run the script with <code>node .</code> from the main
    project folder. However, our main goal is to be able to run our script from anywhere:</p>

  <div class="code">npm install -g .</div>

  <p>This installs your script "globally". Any commands listed in the new bin section of the package.json file will be
    made available as command line applications. You can now run index.js by typing <code>hello</code> at the command
    line - from anywhere. The file(s) referenced in bin have to start with <code>#!/usr/bin/env node</code> (no -S
    options for env, etc.), otherwise the scripts are started without the node executable (so in index, change the
    shebang to the standard one first, or you'll get some error about -S: I sure did). To uninstall your script, run
    the command:</p>

  <div class="code">npm uninstall -g .</div>

  <p>You can list all globally installed node.js modules using:</p>

  <div class="code"> npm ls -g --depth=0</div>

  <p>More importantly, this shows you where these modules are installed at - it is not in the project directory.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>We can modify the color of text and the background with the package <b>chalk</b>. Additionally, we can add borders
    around text with the <b>boxen</b> package. You can add these to the project with:</p>

  <div class="code">npm install chalk boxen</div>

  <p>This will create a folder called <code>node_modules</code>, where the packages (and others) are stored. It also
    creates <code>package-lock.json</code>. This file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies
    either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent
    installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates. In the package.json
    file, it also adds the packages as dependencies. In mine this was:</p>

  <div class="code">
    "dependencies": {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"boxen": "^5.0.1",<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;"chalk": "^4.1.2"<br>
    }
  </div>

  <p>Now, let's put the following code in a new file, <code>bin/color-text.js</code>:</p>

  <div class="code">
    #!/usr/bin/env node<br>
    <br>
    const chalk = require('chalk');<br>
    const boxen = require('boxen');<br>
    <br>
    const greeting = chalk.white.bold('Hello!');<br>
    <br>
    const boxenOptions = {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 1,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 1,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;borderStyle: 'round',<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;borderColor: 'green',<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor: '#555555'<br>
    };<br>
    <br>
    const msgBox = boxen(greeting, boxenOptions);<br>
    <br>
    console.log(msgBox);<br>
  </div>

  <p>The message in the console should look similar to this:</p>

  <div><img src="../images/chalk-boxen.png" alt="A box with a dotted green border, in the console"></div>

  <p>Just for fun, I added <code>"color-text": "node bin/color-text.js"</code> to the <code>"scripts"</code> section in
    my <code>package.json</code> file. I thought that maybe that would allow me to run this file like a simple command
    by simply typing color-text - nope. It is still really easy to do, and doesn't require you to do a global install.
    Use either of the following:</p>

  <div class="code">
    npm run-script color-text.js<br>
    <br>
    npm run color-text.js
  </div>
