    <h1>A Discussion of Cookies</h1>
  </div>

  <p>Cookies were originally designed as a way to maintain state. A cookie is a small text file that is stored
    on a user's machine by the browser. They can be set by a web server or page, but contain nothing executable. It is
    then sent back with each subsequent request, based on a set of rules. Web servers can then use this information. For
    example, many sites have you create a login. Once this process is successfully completed, you would typically set a
    cookie to identify the user, and then they are free to navigate the site so long as that cookie is present and
    validated.</p>

  <p>Cookies can be stored by a web server by sending a HTTP header called Set-Cookie, which has the following format:
  </p>

  <div class="code">Set-Cookie: <em>value</em>[; <em>expires</em>=<i>date</i>i][; <em>domain</em>=<i>domain</i>][;
    <em>path</em>=<i>path</i>][; <em>secure</em>]
  </div>

  <p>The <em>value</em> is typically a string in the format <i>name</i>=<i>value</i>. This is the format from the
    specification, but browsers do no validation, so you could specifiy just a string with no equals sign and it would
    still be stored. When a cookie is present and the rules allow, it is sent to the server with each request, stored in
    an HTTP header called Cookie. It contains just the cookie value without any of the other options, as in:</p>

  <div class="code">Cookie: value</div>

  <p>The next options specified (not value) with Set-Cookie are for the browser's use only and are not retrievable once
    set. The value is the exact value you set - it is not modified in any way. If there are multiple cookies for a given
    request, they are separated by semicolons like so:</p>

  <div class="code">Cookie: value1; value2; name1=value1</div>

  <p>Cookies need not be URL-encoded, though that is the usual implementation. The original specification indicates that
    only three types of characters must be encoded: semicolon, comma, and white space. Almost all implementations
    perform some sort of encoding. For example, in value the name and value are typically encoded separately while the
    equal sign is left alone.</p>

  <p>Options after the cookie value are separted by a semicolon and space. Each specifies rules about when the cookie
    should be sent to the server. The <em>expires</em> option indicates when the cookie should be deleted and no longer
    sent to the server. The value for this option is a date in the format <i>Wdy, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT</i>, such as:
  </p>

  <div class="code">Set-Cookie: name=Steve; expires=Sat, 08 Aug 2021 09:06:45 GMT</div>

  <p>Without the expires option, a cookie is good for only a single session (when the browser is closed). This is
    why youâ€™ll often see a checkbox when signing into a web application asking if you would like your login information
    to be saved: if you select yes, then an expires option is attached to the login cookie.</p>

  <p>The <em>domain</em> option indicates the domain(s) for which the cookie should be sent (by default, the host name
    of the page that set it). The domain option can be used to widen the number of domains for which a cookie is sent.
    For example, for a site that has many subdomains, the cookie can be set to the root site. The browser performs a
    comparison of this value and the url, starting from the end of the url string (<i>tail comparison</i>). The value
    set for domain can only be set to itself (default) or a parent domain.</p>

  <p>The <em>path</em> option is similar to the domain option, but it indicates a URL path that must exist in a request
    to send cookies. The comparison is performed left to right against the url, and can be any fragment of the path
    (/mysite/thispath matches any URL that contains these). The default for this is the full URL that set the cookie,
    and this is only checked after the domain option.</p>
