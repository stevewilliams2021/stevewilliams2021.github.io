  <h1>Page created 8/4/2021</h1>
  <p>Here's a button with default properties and background-color set to red: <button id="button1"
      onclick="alert('I am red');">Button1</button>. It
    does not have a very appealing look.</p>
  <p>By getting rid of the border, setting a font-size of 1rem (not sure what this unit is but whatever for now), and a
    font-family of Roboto, we end up with a slightly better version: <button id="button2"
      onclick="alert('Hard to tell I got clicked because I have no border...');">Button2</button>. This,
    however, is not really the best way to do this.</p>
  <hr>
  <div id="div1">This is a div</div>
  <p>We will first discuss <code>display: initial</code>, which reveals something about the browser that many people do
    not understand. Note our div above, which by default has <code>display: block</code> (div is a block element). You
    would think since this is the default value, then if you were to set display to the value initial that it would be
    the same as setting it to block - it is not. Here is what it looks like:
  <div id="div2">This is a div</div>. Note that it is now being displayed inline, not block. You can verify this by
  inspecting the element, going to the <b>Computed</b> tab, and searching for the display property - it is indeed
  inline. The default for browsers is block, but the default in the CSS specification is inline (for the display
  attribute, and this specific example, click <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#formal_definition">this</a>). Setting display to
  initial sets it to the value defined in the specification. It gets the default of block from the <em>user agent
    stylesheet</em>, which is whatever styles a particular browser applies. Fun fact though: on my browser this does not
  display properly, nor format properly in VS Code with the <code>Alt+Shift+F</code> command.
  </p>
  <div class="pdiv">On my computer, though the 2nd div was inline, the browser basically inserts a new line before it
    when it is contained within a &lt;p&gt; element. You can't put a &lt;div&gt; inside a &lt;p&gt; and get consistent
    results from varioius browsers. Provide the browsers with valid HTML and they will behave better. Here is another
    &lt;div&gt; that is identical to the last one: <div id="div3">This is a div</div>. This one is being displayed
    properly, as a &lt;div&gt; can contain another &lt;div&gt; and get consistent results (and it autoformats correctly
    in VS Code editor now as well).
  </div>
  <p>There are basically 3 tiers of CSS:
  <ol>
    <li>The <em>initial</em> styles defined in the formal CSS definition</li>
    <li>Browser specific styes (user agent stylesheet, when you inspect)</li>
    <li>Custom styles that you write in your own CSS</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Next we look at <code>display: inherit</code>. Consider the following:</p>
  <div id="div4">
    This is a div
    <p>This is a p</p>
  </div>
  <p>We have a div, containing text and a child p element with text. Both have been given a font-size of 2rem. In the
    CSS
    specification (see earlier link, same section), you can see what properties are inherited by default from their
    parents - font-size is one such property. Thus both text strings in our example have the 2rem applied (div text
    because rule applies to it directly, the p text because it is inherited from the parent div definition). An example
    of a property that does not inherit from its parent would be border (note no border around p, not an inherited
    property):</p>
  <div id="div5">
    This is a div
    <p>This is a p</p>
  </div>
  <p>But if we use <code>border: inherit</code> in the p contained in the div, we have:</p>
  <div id="div6">
    This is a div
    <p>This is a p</p>
  </div>
  <p>Setting a property to inherit can make an element inherit values from its parent that it would normally not, as in
    this example. Another useful place for using inherit is the font-family for buttons, which inherit a different style
    from the rest of the page by default (from the user agent stylesheet). You can use <code>font-family: inherit</code>
    on a button to make it inherit the same font style as the rest of your page. Note that inherit actually instructs
    the element to inherit the style from its parent element.</p>
  <p>The next value a property can be given is <code>unset</code>, which is just a combination of initial and inherit.
    If the property by default inherits, then it sets the property to inherit. If the property does not inherit (such as
    display), then it is set to initial. It is not generally all that useful, as you could just set a property to
    initial or inherit. It does, however, have a use when you want to set a bunch of properties all at once to initial
    or inherit. That is where the <code>all</code> property comes in. If we set <code>all: unset</code>, then all
    properties that need to be set to initial will be put to initial, and all that are specified to inherit will
    inherit. Consider our original button with all: unset (and red background): <button id="button3"
      onclick="alert('My border, margins and padding are gone');">Button3</button>.</p>
  <p>Using all with unset can be used to remove a lot of the default styles that you don't actually want. The last value
    that is discussed is <code>revert</code>, which sets a value to the value in the user agent stylesheet. It could be
    used after all: unset to restore a particular style but reset all others (<button id="button4"
      onclick="alert('All unset, but got my border back!');">Button4</button>), but generally you'd be better off just
    doing the unset then writing new rules. Use revert when you need to reliably restore a value to what it originally
    looks like in the browser.</p>
